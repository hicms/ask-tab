# WhatsApp

AskTab connects to WhatsApp via the Baileys WebSocket client, running in the offscreen document. Messages are received in real time and routed through the agent system.

## Setup

1. Open the **Options** page → **Channels** → **WhatsApp**
2. Enable the WhatsApp channel
3. A QR code will appear — scan it with your WhatsApp mobile app (Settings → Linked Devices → Link a Device)
4. Once linked, the status will show "WhatsApp linked"
5. Add allowed sender IDs to the allowlist

### Allowed senders

The `allowedSenderIds` list controls who can interact with the agent. Add phone numbers in JID format:

```
12345678901@s.whatsapp.net
```

Device suffixes are automatically stripped for matching — `12345:67@s.whatsapp.net` matches `12345@s.whatsapp.net`.

## Direction filtering

WhatsApp supports separate controls for message direction:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `acceptFromMe` | `true` | Process messages you send from your phone |
| `acceptFromOthers` | `false` | Process messages from other people |

This lets you use AskTab as a personal assistant by sending messages to yourself, or open it to specific contacts.

## Message handling

### Inbound messages

Each inbound message includes:

- **Sender ID** — WhatsApp JID (phone@s.whatsapp.net)
- **Chat type** — Direct or group (only direct messages are processed)
- **Body** — Message text
- **Voice flag** — Whether the message is a voice note

### Voice messages

- Inbound voice messages are detected via the `isAudio` flag
- Audio is decrypted and transcribed using the configured STT engine
- The transcript replaces the audio in the message body sent to the agent

When TTS is enabled for outbound messages:
- Responses are synthesized using the configured TTS engine
- Audio is sent back as a WhatsApp PTT (Push-to-Talk) voice message via the offscreen document

### Message formatting

AskTab converts LLM markdown output to WhatsApp markup:

| Markdown | WhatsApp |
|----------|----------|
| `**bold**` | `*bold*` |
| `*italic*` | `_italic_` |
| `` `code` `` | `` ```code``` `` |
| `~~strike~~` | `~strike~` |
| `[text](url)` | `text (url)` |

Code blocks and protected content are processed carefully to avoid formatting conflicts.

### Message splitting

Messages longer than 4,096 characters are automatically split at natural boundaries (newlines, then spaces).

## Connection model

WhatsApp uses a **push-based** WebSocket connection maintained by the Baileys library in the offscreen document:

- No polling needed — messages arrive in real time
- Auth credentials stored in `chrome.storage.local` at key `wa-auth-creds`
- Connection persists as long as the offscreen document is alive

<Warning>
Chrome may reclaim the offscreen document under memory pressure, which will disconnect WhatsApp. The watchdog alarm recreates it automatically, but there may be a brief gap in message delivery.
</Warning>
